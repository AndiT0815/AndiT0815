- 👋 Hi, I’m Andreas Trenkwalder, currently working at LENS, CNR-INO and physics department of the university of Florence, Italy
- 👀 I’m basic researcher doing experimental physics on ultracold atoms but I do as well a lot of software and hardware developments for the lab - and for fun
- 🌱 currently, I am working on an experiment control system based on a low cost FPGA-SoC board which replaces and upgrades an outdated system 
- 💞️ I’m interested on hardware development and how to control it by software. the ideas are application driven but often also just out of curisosity.
- 📫 you can find me on the web
